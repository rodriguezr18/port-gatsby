## About


##### My name is Rudy Rodriguez and I am an upcoming Software Engineer, I have recently been given the opportunity to participate in a six month rigorous program with road to hire where my professional development and coding skills were put to the test.


As a child I was alienated, due to the fact that my parents both immigrated to the U.S for a better life, while they worked countless hours in order to provide for my siblings and I, I was raised by my grandmother throughout my childhood. This is where I found myself isolated from the world, luckily I had technology all around me, I would surf the web meticulously for efficient ways to approach situations, and this is where my love for technology set in motion.
